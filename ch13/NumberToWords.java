// Phone numbers and PIN codes can be easier to remember when you find words that spell out the number on a standard phone pad.
// For example, instead of remembering the combination 5282, you can just think of JAVA.
//
// Write a recursive method that, given a number, yields all possible spellings (which may or may not be real words).
//
// checking the words against the /usr/share/dict/words file on your computer, or the words.txt file in the companion code for this book.
// For a given number, return only actual words.
